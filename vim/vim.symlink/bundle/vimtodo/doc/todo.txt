*todo.txt*  Vim todo list plugin

Vim todo list plugin                                            *vimtodo*

Plugin for managing hierarchical to do lists in vim.

==============================================================================
ABOUT                                                   *vimtodo-about*

Vimtodo originally started out as a set of syntax highlights for the todo.txt
(http://www.todotxt.com/) format in vim with a few added extras such as
subtasks. However, it quickly grew into a fully fledged task management
system, taking several ideas from Emacs' org-mode (http://www.orgmode.org/).

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION                                            *vimtodo-installation*

Untar the archive to ~/.vim. If you wish, untar to a temporary directory, and
copy the contents of the autoload/, doc/, ftplugin/ and syntax/ directories to
the respective directories in your ~/.vim directory.

Alternatively, if you have pathogen installed, untar the entire archive to
~/.vim/bundle/vimtodo/.

==============================================================================
BASIC TODO ENTRIES                                      *vimtodo-basics*

To start with, open up a new file, and add the following line to the
beginning: >
    # vim:ft=todo

This line tells vim that the file is a vimtodo file. See |modeline| for more
information. Now write the file, quit and reopen it. Alternatively, you can
just type the following to set the filetype without reopening the file: >
    :set ft=todo

To do entries are simply lines in the file that follow a specific format. Add
the following line into the file: >
    TODO 2009-09-01 @computer +learnvim Read vim tutorial

This is a todo entry. You can also add a new entry, with the 'cn' alias. In
insert mode, type 'cn' and a new todo entry along with the current date will
be added. You can also use <LocalLeader>cn in normal mode to add a new entry.

The todo entry is made up of several parts:

    TODO - the task status, this is something like TODO, DONE, WAITING
    2009-09-01 - the task creation date
    @computer - the context of the task, in this case, something to do at the
                computer
    +learnvim - the project the task is associated with

Giving multiple tasks a context or project tag allows you to filter out just
the tasks you are interested in using the filter function (described later).

For now, press escape to go back to normal mode, make sure the cursor is on
the same line at the todo entry you just added, and press <LocalLeader>cs (\cs
by default). The task status will change to 'DONE' and the line will be greyed
out. Here, several things have happened:

    - The task status changed from TODO to DONE
    - The entire task changes color to show that the task is complete
    - A CLOSED: line has been added underneath showing the date and time that
      the task was closed.
    - A logbook entry has been added (but is currently hidden), logging the
      time and date of the task state change.

A CLOSED: entry is added whenever a task is closed, and will be removed
if a task is re-opened.

Logbook entries however, log the date and time every time you change the state
of a task, and look like this: >

    :LOGBOOK:
        TODO: 2009-09-30 18:19:51
        CANCELLED: 2009-09-30 18:19:50
        DONE: 2009-09-30 18:12:58

Currently the todo entry is folded, so move the cursor to the fold line (just
below the todo entry) and press zO to open all the folds. Then move the cursor
back to the todo line and press <LocalLeader>cs to change the task status a
few times to see the behavior of the closed/logbook lines.

If desired, the display of closed/logbook lines can be turned off in your
.vimrc. See the configuration section for more details.

You can add more information to a task using normal text editing commands.
Anything that is indented is considered to be information that is part of a
todo entry. For example, the closed and logbook lines are indented and
considered part of the todo entry.

A due date for a task can be added. Add the following to the end of the
original todo entry you added earlier: {2009-09-30}. This will be highlighted
just like the task date. If you wish to add the current date, type in ds. For
example {ds} will set a deadline of today.

If you have tasks with due dates, you can use several commands to view tasks
that are due soon:

    <LocalLeader>cd - Show tasks due today
    <LocalLeader>cf - Show tasks due tomorrow
    <LocalLeader>cw - Show tasks due within 7 days
    <LocalLeader>cx - Show overdue tasks (tasks that were due sometime in the past
                 year)

Each of these opens up another buffer listing the matching entries. Pressing
enter on one of the items in the list will take you to the corresponding
entry. Try this - change the deadline for your task to today, and type
<LocalLeader>cd.

You can filter on other criteria too, such as context or project using the
:Filter ex command. It takes a regular expression and will show matching
tasks. For example: >

    :Filter @home

which would bring up all tasks with a context of @home.

==============================================================================
TASK STATES         *vimtodo-state* *vimtodo-taskstate* *vimtodo-taskstates*

The first word of a task in all caps shows the tasks state. Normally it is is
something like TODO or DONE, but the available states can be configured as
needed.

Task states can be changed in one of two ways: The <LocalLeader>cs normal mode
command, and the <LocalLeader>cv normal mode command.

<LocalLeader>cs will cycle through the task states (by default, TODO, DONE,
CANCELLED) See |vimtodo-statprogression| for more information on this.

<LocalLeader>cv will bring up a prompt asking you to pick which state you want to
switch to. Press the letter associated with the state to immediately change
the task to that state.

Some task states are considered "done" states. In these states, the entire
task is highlighted in the same color (as if it was a comment) and a CLOSED
tag is added to the task to show the date and time the task was closed.

In addition to the closed task, whenever a tasks state is changed, the state
change is appended to the task in a LOGBOOK section (or "drawer"). This is an
indented part of the task with one line for each state change.

The closed/logbook behavior can be configured in your .vimrc using the
'g:todo_log_done' and 'g:todo_log_drawer' settings. Alternatively, you can set
this behavior on a per file basis using the LOGDONE and LOGDRAWER properties.
See |vimtodo-config| for more information on these settings.

STATE PROGRESSION *vimtodo-stateprogression*

When using <LocalLeader>cs to change between task states, the state will cycle
between succesive states in the progression, and back to the beginning if the
final state is reached. The progression can be configured, but the default
states are:

TODO -> DONE -> CANCELLED
WAITING -> CLOSED

If you wish to change to a state that is on a different progression (e.g. from
TODO to WAITING), then you can use the <LocalLeader>cv command to jump direct
to that state.

==============================================================================
ARCHIVING                               *vimtodo-archive* *vimtodo-archiving*

VimTODO can move all completed tasks to another file to reduce clutter. The
<LocalLeader>ca command is used for this. Any task that has been closed will
be moved to the done file, which by default is 'done.txt' in the same
directory as the todo file.

The name of the done file can be changed using the g:todo_done_file .vimrc
setting or on a per-file basis using the DONEFILE property.

==============================================================================
CHECKBOXES                                              *vimtodo-checkboxes*

In addition to tasks with a given state, Vimtodo can manage checkboxes. Any
line in a file can contain a checkbox. It doesn't have to be a task heading,
and in fact it probably isn't a good idea to mix task entries (with a state)
and checkboxes.

To create a checkbox, simply type [ ] in insert mode. Alternatively, you can
use <LocalLeader>cn in normal mode to add a checkbox to the beginning of a
line.  Note that if you do this on the header line for a task, it will be
inserted before the task state (e.g. TODO) and the task will lose any special
meaning.

To toggle a checkbox, use the <LocalLeader>cc command. By default, a checkbox
will be checked with an X, and another use of <LocalLeader>cc will uncheck the
box.  However, like task states, there are a number of states a checkbox can
cycle through: >

    [ ] -> [X]
    [+] -> [-] -> [.]
    [Y] -> [N] -> [?]

To use one of these other progressions, simply start with the relevant state
when creating your checkbox. For example, type [Y] in insert mode to create a
Y/N/? check box.

Again, like task states, checkbox state progression can be configured. The
g:todo_checkbox_states variable and the CHECKBOXSTATES property controls this
behavior.

==============================================================================
TASK LINKS                              *vimtodo-tasklinks* *vimtodo-links*

Vimtodo can be configured to reference an external task management system. By
adding tidXXXX to your task, you can use <LocalLeader>ct to open up a web page
showing the external task.

For example:

You have an external task management system where all tickets are available on
the web at the following URL: http://tasks.example.com/tickets/tid=12345 (for
ticket #12345)

Set up the g:todo_taskurl variable in your .vimrc to be the same as the above
url, substituting '%s' for the ticket number. In addition, you need to set the
g:todo_browser variable to be a command to load a web page in your browser. In
the example below, gnome-open is used to open the default browser (If you are
using Linux/Gnome): >

      let g:todo_taskurl="http://tasks.example.com/tickets/tid=%s"
      let g:todo_browser="gnome-open"

You wish to reference this ticket in a TODO entry, so you add tid12345
to the ticket. At this point, <LocalLeader>ct will open up your web browser
and take you to the referenced ticket.

Vimtodo can also open any URL in a web browser if the g:todo_browser variable
is configured. To do this, use <LocalLeader>cl and any http/https link on the
current line will be opened in the web browser.

==============================================================================
FOLDING

Any extra data added to an entry (be it the logbook/closed tags, or notes on a
task) is indented from the first line, and is folded away when the file is
first opened using vim's folding features. Folding is based on the indentation
of the text.

All of vim's normal folding commands can be used to manipulate what is
hidden/shown. For a good overview on this, see |fold-commands|. However, the
basic commands used to open/close folds are |zo| and |zc| (both normal mode
commands).

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                       *vimtodo-config* *vimtodo-configuration*

Much of vimtodo's behavior can be changed if desired. There are two options
for configuration: variables in .vimrc and properties.

PROPERTIES                                              *vimtodo-properties*

Properties are simply per-file configuration options that you add to the
beginning of a todo file. They are all contained in a :SETTINGS: drawer,
usually near the top of the file, and each setting begins with a + sign:
For example: >

    :SETTINGS:
        +DONEFILE: custom_done_file.txt
        +LOGDONE: 0

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS                                   *vimtodo-configoptions*

g:todo_checkbox_states              (property: +CHECKBOXSTATES)

    Sets the list of checkbox state progressions.

    If set in the vimrc file, this is a list of valid checkbox progressions,
    each progression of which is itself a list. To set multiple checkbox
    progressions using properties, just use multiple +CHECKBOXSTATES lines.

    Examples (vimrc first, then properties example below): >

    let g:todo_checkbox_states = [
        \["A", "B", "C"],
        \["1", "2", "3"]]

    :SETTINGS:
        +CHECKBOXSTATES: A B C
        +CHECKBOXSTATES: 1 2 3

g:todo_done_file                    (property: +DONEFILE)

    Set the name of the file to archive done tasks into. (Default: done.txt)

g:todo_log_done                     (property: +LOGDONE)

    Enable/disable logging of the time a task is done with the CLOSED: tag.
    Set to 1 to enable logging, 0 to disable.  (Default: 1)

g:todo_log_into_drawer              (property: +LOGDRAWER)

    Set the name of the drawer to log state changes into. If blank, then don't
    log state changes into a drawer. (Default: LOGBOOK)

g:todo_states                       (property: +STATES)

    Set a custom list of valid task states.

    If set in the vimrc file, this is a list of valid state progressions, each
    progression of which is itself a list. To set multiple state progressions
    using properties, just use multiple +STATES lines.

    If '|' is included in a given state progression, it separates normal
    states from "done" states. If '|' is not present, then all states in that
    progression are normal states. To have a progression made entirely of done
    states, put '|' as the first entry in the list.

    Each state should be in all caps (e.g. TODO). An optional shortcut key
    (for use with <LocalLeader>cv) can be added in parentheses after the state
    (e.g. "TODO(t)").

    To set the colors for each state, see the g:todo_state_colors option.

    Examples (vimrc first, then properties example below): >

    let g:todo_states=[['TODO(t)', '|', 'DONE(d)', 'CANCELLED(c)'],
        \['WAITING(w)', 'HOLD(h)', 'INPROGRESS(i)', 'SOMEDAY(s)', 'CLOSED(l)']]

    :SETTINGS:
        +STATES: TODO(t) | DONE(d) CANCELLED(c)
        +STATES: WAITING(w) HOLD(g) INPROGRESS(i) SOMEDAY(s) CLOSED(l)

g:todo_state_colors                 (property: +STATECOLORS)

    Set the highlight colors for each state.

    This is a map from state names to colors. Any color name recognized by vim
    can be used here. Standard colors such as 'Red', 'Blue', 'Green', 'Grey'
    are all recognized.

    When using the +STATECOLORS property, use a colon to separate the state
    name from the color, separate each state/color pair with a comma, and use
    multiple property lines if required.

    Examples (vimrc first, then properties example below): >

    let g:todo_state_colors= {
        \'DONE': 'Green',
        \'CLOSED': 'Grey',
        \'CANCELLED': 'Red',
        \'TODO': 'Blue',
        \'WAITING': 'Yellow',
        \'HOLD': 'Grey',
        \'INPROGRESS': 'Cyan',
        \'SOMEDAY': 'Grey'
        \}

    :SETTINGS:
        +STATECOLORS: DONE:Green, CLOSED:Grey, CANCELLED:Red, TODO:Blue
        +STATECOLORS: WAITING:Yellow, HOLD:Grey, INPROGRESS:Cyan
        +STATECOLORS: SOMEDAY:Grey

g:todo_taskurl                      (property: +TASKURL)

    Sets the url for referencing external task manager tickets using tidXXXX
    format in an entry.

    Any occurence of %s in the URL will be replaced with the id of the ticket
    when <LocalLeader>ct is used.

    Default: blank (<LocalLeader>ct does nothing)

g:todo_browser                      (property: +BROWSER)

    Sets the command to use when loading a url or external ticket. The command
    is executed with a single parameter - the URL to load in the browser.

    If you are running GNOME, then 'gnome-open' is a good choice, as it will
    load your default browser. Likewise, Mac users can use 'open' for this. If
    you want a specific browser to open, you can specify that instead.

    Default: blank (any commands that require this will have no effect)

==============================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING                                     *vimtodo-troubleshooting*

When I load a todo file (or set ft=todo), the syntax coloring shows up, but
none of the commands seem to work.

    Make sure you have filetype plugins enabled in your vim config. This can
    be done by adding 'filetype plugin on' to your .vimrc file. See
    |:filetype-plugin-on| for more details.
